      <strong>Beauty! (By Thanushri Pooja S)</strong><br />
      <br>
Say not of beauty she is good,<br />
Or aught but beautiful,<br>
Or sleek to doves’ wings of the wood <br>
Her wild wings of a gull. <br>
<br>

Call her not wicked; that word’s touch <br>
Consumes her like a curse; <br>
But love her not too much, too much, <br>
For that is even worse. <br>
O, she is neither good nor bad, <br>
But innocent and wild! <br>
Enshrine her and she dies, who had <br>
The hard heart of a child. <br>
